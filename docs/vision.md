# Multi-Agent Specialist Quality Engineer

## Vision Statement

We are building a multi-agent AI system that functions as a Specialist Quality Engineer, composed
of modular agents — each responsible for a focused aspect of the software quality lifecycle.

From early requirement refinement and scenario design to BDD test generation and continuous
feedback integration, each agent collaborates, communicates, and improves over time.

Crucially, this system is aligned with your organization’s unique standards, strategy, and ways of
working, ensuring every output reinforces engineering excellence and business intent — not just
functional correctness.

## 🎯 Purpose

To redefine quality engineering by deploying a team of specialized AI agents that work together —
like an experienced cross-functional quality team — to accelerate product delivery, raise quality
standards, and embed strategic alignment from ideation to execution.

## ⚙️ Key Capabilities

### 🗣️ Business Clarification Agent

- Engages users in natural conversation to clarify vague ideas and produce structured, testable
  business requirements.
- Applies organizational vocabulary and business strategy to ground output in context.

### 🔄 Technical Translation Agent

- Translates business intent into technical assumptions, constraints, and system-level
  requirements.
- Incorporates approved architecture, APIs, data models, and tech stack guidelines.

### 📜 Scenario Designer Agent

- Creates detailed Given-When-Then scenarios per requirement, addressing:
  - Positive paths
  - Edge cases
  - Negative flows
  - Business logic edge boundaries

### 🔍 Scenario Reviewer Agent

- Assesses quality, coverage, and risk-awareness of each scenario.
- Flags ambiguous logic, missing cases, or weak alignment to requirements.

### 🧩 User Story Generator Agent

- Decomposes requirements into structured user stories with persona linkage and acceptance
  criteria.
- Formats according to internal agile/SAFe/story-writing standards.

### ✅ Story Quality Reviewer Agent

- Ensures that user stories are testable, complete, atomic, and scoped correctly.
- Flags inconsistencies or misalignment with stakeholder goals.

### 🧪 BDD Test Specification Agent

- Generates test-ready feature files and specs aligned with tools like Cucumber, Behave, or
  SpecFlow.
- Maps to existing test libraries and automation conventions.

### 🔁 BDD Reviewer Agent

- Reviews BDD specs for completeness, clarity, syntax correctness, and reuse of shared
  steps/components.

### 📊 Feedback & Learning Agent

- Analyzes:
  - Test results
  - Defect patterns
  - Production incidents
- Uses this to refine future stories, scenarios, and test specs — learning from real-world
  feedback.

## 💡 What Makes This Different

- **👥 Agent Specialization**: Each agent is a domain expert, ensuring precision and depth.
- **🗨️ Conversational Refinement**: Agents ask for clarification, resolve ambiguity, and
  collaborate like a human team.
- **📚 Organizational Awareness**: Agents consume internal documentation (e.g., test strategies,
  coding guidelines, playbooks) to ensure alignment with your quality goals and standards.
- **🧠 Feedback-Driven Learning**: Agents continuously learn from actual outcomes to improve future
  artifact generation.
- **🧱 Composable & Extensible**: The system is modular — new agents or policies can be introduced
  without rewriting the whole pipeline.
- **Built-in Quality Gates**: Each output is reviewed by peer agents to ensure coverage, clarity,
  and consistency.

## 📈 Strategic Outcomes

- Faster, higher-quality releases grounded in consistent standards.
- Better alignment between business requirements, technical implementation, and testing.
- Reduced manual QA/test effort, with automated generation and review of quality artifacts.
- A self-improving system that gets smarter and more aligned with your organization over time.
